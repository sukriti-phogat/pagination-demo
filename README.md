# Pagination and Filtering Demo

This GitHub repository contains a simple web application that demonstrates pagination, search, and filtering functionalities. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each page displays 10 rows of data, and users can search for specific items, filter the data, and delete selected rows.

## Features

1. **Pagination:** Navigate through the dataset with ease using the pagination controls, i.e., prev, next, first and last buttons.
2. **Search and Filter:** Find specific items by using the search feature. To remove all filters, clear the search bar and press enter.
3. **Select Multiple Rows:** Select rows using the checkboxes in each row or at the top of each page. Selected rows are highlighted in grey.
4. **Delete Rows:** Delete individual rows or selected rows to customize the displayed data.
